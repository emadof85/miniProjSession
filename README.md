# Tourism Services Website Development - ASP.Net Core

## Project Objective

This project aims to develop a service-oriented website for a travel agency that provides car rental and diverse tourism booking services using **ASP.Net Core**. It includes creating both backend and frontend interfaces integrated with a **RESTful API** system. The focus is on enhancing user interaction with the platform through an integrated booking system. The project also incorporates strong **token-based authentication** mechanisms such as **JWT**, utilizes the **MVC architectural pattern** for flexibility and maintainability, and adopts best design practices like the **Repository Pattern**.
